# Feedraptor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/merongivian/feedraptor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/merongivian/feedraptor/)

Feedraptor is an Elixir library for parsing feeds, inspired by Ruby's [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira). Parsing is done in pure
Elixir thanks to [Capuli](https://github.com/merongivian/capuli)

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `Feedraptor` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:feedraptor, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rss/blog/automaton/fulltext"
|> HTTPoison.get!() #You could use other alternatives like Tesla, HTTPotion, HTTPipe, etc.
|> Map.get(:body)
|> Feedraptor.parse()

## Supported Feed/Entry properties

Depends on the type of feed, for more info of supported attributes check the [hex docs](https://hexdocs.pm/feedraptor/Feedraptor.html)

## Why [feedraptor]( https://github.com/merongivian/Feedraptor) instead of [feeder_ex](https://github.com/manukall/feeder_ex) ?

`feeder_ex` is a wrapper for Erlang's `feeder`. Feeder has support for a limited type
of feeds and doesn't parse all entrie's fields (like content)

## Why [capuli](https://github.com/philss/capuli) instead of [xmerl](https://github.com/erlang-labs/xmerl) ?

There a couple of good libraries that use `xmerl` and do a great job parsing
xml, like [Quinn](https://github.com/nhu313/Quinn). The problem with `xmerl` is
that it crashes when it receives a malformed XML, which seems to crash the `xmerl` application
as well. This is not ideal when fetching a bunch of feeds that might be malformed, and crawling
those trough OTP.

Also `xmerl` is build in Erlang, `capuli` uses Floki which is built in Elixir.

## Similar Libraries/Credits

After i started this i found a similar library [elixir feed parser](https://github.com/fdietz/elixir-feed-parser), i took
some ideas from here, particularly date parsing
