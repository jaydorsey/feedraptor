# Feedraptor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/merongivian/feedraptor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/merongivian/feedraptor/)

**DISCLAIMER**: This is not ready yet

Feedraptor is an Elixir library for parsing feeds, inspired by Ruby's [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira). Parsing is done in pure
Elixir thanks to [Floki](https://github.com/philss/floki)

## Usage

```elixir
"http://www.rssboard.org/files/sample-rss-2.xml"
|> HTTPoison.get!() #You could use other alternatives like Tesla, HTTPotion, HTTPipe, etc.
|> Feedraptor.parse()

## Why [feedraptor]( https://github.com/merongivian/Feedraptor) instead of [feeder_ex](https://github.com/manukall/feeder_ex) ?

`feeder_ex` is a wrapper for Erlang's `feeder`. Feeder has support for a limited type
of feeds and doesn't parse all entrie's fields (like content)

## Why [floki](https://github.com/philss/floki) instead of [xmerl](https://github.com/erlang-labs/xmerl) ?

There a couple of good libraries that use `xmerl` and do a great job parsing
xml, like [Quinn](https://github.com/nhu313/Quinn). The problem with `xmerl` is
that it crashes when it receives a malformed XML. This is not ideal when fetching a bunch of
feeds that might be malformed, and crawling those trough OTP.

Also xmerl is build in Erlang. Parsing trough Floki requires a little bit more work but at least i'm using Elixir,
so i know what to expect if something goes wrong.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `Feedraptor` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:feedraptor, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/Feedraptor](https://hexdocs.pm/Feedraptor).
